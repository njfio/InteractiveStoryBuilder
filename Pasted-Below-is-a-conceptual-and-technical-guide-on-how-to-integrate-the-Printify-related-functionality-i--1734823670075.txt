Below is a conceptual and technical guide on how to integrate the Printify-related functionality (i.e., uploading designs, selecting blueprints, and AI-driven image placement) into your existing system, which uses:
	•	Frontend: React (TypeScript) + ShadCN UI
	•	Backend: Express.js + RESTful APIs
	•	Database: PostgreSQL via Neon + Supabase integration
	•	ORM: Drizzle (for type-safe database ops)

We’ll focus on how to incorporate Printify’s integration logically (the overall architecture and flow) and functionally (breaking down into composable functions) within this application. We’ll also discuss how this interacts with your business rules (authentication, content management, exports, etc.) and how to structure it from a functional programming standpoint in your Node/Express application.

1. Where Printify Fits in Your Application

From the system outline, we have a few major features:
	1.	Manuscript Management (Markdown content, chunking, etc.)
	2.	AI-Powered Image Generation (Replicate’s Luma Photon)
	3.	Content Export System (EPUB, DOCX, etc.)
	4.	Authentication & Authorization (Supabase-based, role-based)

Why Integrate Printify?

	•	You might want to turn your generated images (from the AI pipeline) into printed merchandise (mugs, T-shirts, posters, etc.) or you have an e-commerce component.
	•	You could allow authors to “Publish to Printify” as an additional “Export” type, bridging your content/images into physical products.
	•	This can be a premium feature for authors, or used by your application to raise funds, etc.

Data Flow Example

	1.	Author Uploads / Generates Image
	•	The image is stored in your system (Supabase storage or local) and associated with a manuscript chunk.
	2.	User Chooses to Create a Product
	•	The user selects an image from the gallery (or the final AI-generated image).
	•	The system calls Printify’s API to upload that image and create a product (like a T-shirt).
	3.	Product Data Stored
	•	You store references to the Printify product_id, the chosen blueprint_id, etc., in your database (via Drizzle).
	4.	User Publishes (Optional)
	•	They can choose to publish the product on Printify or keep it as a draft.

2. Functional Programming Approach in Node/Express

Though your original Printify script was demonstrated in Python, you can:
	1.	Rewrite the core steps in JavaScript/TypeScript for Node.
	2.	Wrap them in a microservice or a serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda) that is called from your Express server.
	3.	Modularize into pure functions where possible.

Key Functional Patterns

	•	Pure Functions: Each function takes in data (e.g., an image path or a buffer) and returns a result (or a Promise). It should not rely on hidden global state.
	•	Composition / Pipelines: For example, you can compose a pipeline that:
	1.	Fetches blueprint data,
	2.	Uploads the image,
	3.	Creates the product,
	4.	Publishes the product.
	•	Stateless Services: If possible, keep your business logic in discrete services that do not rely on ephemeral states. Store all persistent references (like upload_id or product_id) in your database.

3. High-Level Integration Steps

A. Create a “PrintifyService” in Your Backend

In your Express.js project structure, you might have a folder like services/printifyService.ts (or .js). That service could expose pure functions for each main Printify task:
	1.	getBlueprints() – returns an array of blueprint data from Printify.
	2.	uploadImage(fileBuffer: Buffer, fileName: string) – uploads an image to Printify, returns upload_id.
	3.	createProduct(params: { uploadId, blueprintId, … }) – creates a product, returns product_id.
	4.	publishProduct(productId: string) – publishes the product.
	5.	calculateAIPlacement(imageBuffer: Buffer | localPath: string) – returns (x, y, scale, angle) using AI or naive image fitting.

All these functions:
	•	Receive inputs as arguments
	•	Return results or Promises
	•	Keep side effects (like logging, DB updates) minimal/explicit

Example: uploadImage in TypeScript

import axios from 'axios';

export async function uploadImage(fileBuffer: Buffer, fileName: string): Promise<string> {
  const PRINTIFY_API_TOKEN = process.env.PRINTIFY_API_TOKEN;
  const url = 'https://api.printify.com/v1/uploads/images.json';

  const formData = new FormData();
  formData.append('file', new Blob([fileBuffer]), fileName);

  const res = await axios.post(url, formData, {
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${PRINTIFY_API_TOKEN}`,
      'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data'
    }
  });

  if (res.status === 200) {
    return res.data.id; // upload_id
  } else {
    throw new Error(`Error uploading image: ${res.data}`);
  }
}

	Make sure to configure FormData or a library like form-data properly. In Node, Blob might require a polyfill or you can use form-data.

B. Express Route Handlers

Your routes (e.g., /api/printify/upload) call these service functions. For example:

import express from 'express';
import { uploadImage, createProduct } from '../services/printifyService';

const printifyRouter = express.Router();

printifyRouter.post('/upload', async (req, res) => {
  try {
    // 1. Validate user auth & roles (only an author can do this)
    // 2. Extract image buffer from request (or retrieve from your DB / supabase)
    const { imageBuffer, fileName, blueprintId } = req.body;

    // 3. Upload to Printify
    const uploadId = await uploadImage(imageBuffer, fileName);

    // 4. Create product
    const productId = await createProduct({
      uploadId,
      blueprintId,
      title: `My Product - ${fileName}`,
      description: 'Auto-created from our system'
    });

    // 5. Optionally store productId in your DB via Drizzle, relating it to the user/manuscript
    // 6. Respond
    return res.json({ productId });
  } catch (error) {
    return res.status(500).json({ error: (error as Error).message });
  }
});

export default printifyRouter;

C. Database (Drizzle) Integration

You’ll likely have a PrintifyProducts table (or something similar) to store references:

CREATE TABLE PrintifyProducts (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id UUID NOT NULL,          -- referencing your 'users' table or Supabase auth
  manuscript_id UUID NOT NULL,    -- referencing a 'manuscripts' table
  product_id TEXT NOT NULL,       -- from Printify
  blueprint_id INT NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);

Using Drizzle in TypeScript, you might define:

import { pgTable, serial, text, integer, timestamp, uuid } from "drizzle-orm/pg-core";

export const printifyProducts = pgTable("PrintifyProducts", {
  id: serial("id").primaryKey(),
  userId: uuid("user_id").notNull(),
  manuscriptId: uuid("manuscript_id").notNull(),
  productId: text("product_id").notNull(),
  blueprintId: integer("blueprint_id").notNull(),
  createdAt: timestamp("created_at").defaultNow(),
  updatedAt: timestamp("updated_at").defaultNow()
});

Then in your route, after creating the product:

await db.insert(printifyProducts).values({
  userId: currentUserId,
  manuscriptId,
  productId,
  blueprintId
});

4. Business Rules & Authentication Flow

A. Authentication/Authorization

	•	Only Authors can create or manage Printify products.
	•	Public vs. Private manuscripts might not matter for Printify, but ensure the user owns the manuscript.
	•	Your route handlers (e.g., /api/printify/upload) should:
	1.	Check JWT or Supabase session token.
	2.	Confirm the user’s role is “author.”
	3.	Check the user owns the manuscript if it’s manuscript-specific.

B. Content Management

	•	If your “AI-Powered Image Generation” step is triggered first, you’d store the final images in your system.
	•	After or simultaneously, you can pass those images to Printify.
	•	You might also want to store a reference to the original chunk or manuscript section the image belongs to.

C. Export System Considerations

	•	When an author exports a manuscript, you might:
	•	Show them an option to “Export to Printify” or “Generate Merchandise” as a special action.
	•	For doc exports (EPUB, DOCX, etc.), it’s a separate pipeline from Printify. But you could include “product links” in the final exports.

5. AI-Driven Placement

A. Node-Based AI Placement

Since you’re using Node, you can adopt a similar approach as in the Python example with sharp or jimp for image manipulation:

import sharp from 'sharp';

async function calculateAIPlacement(buffer: Buffer, printAreaWidth: number, printAreaHeight: number) {
  // Get image dimensions
  const { width, height } = await sharp(buffer).metadata();

  // Simple ratio-based logic
  const designRatio = (width ?? 1) / (height ?? 1);
  const productRatio = printAreaWidth / printAreaHeight;

  let scaleFactor: number;
  if (designRatio > productRatio) {
    scaleFactor = printAreaWidth / (width ?? 1);
  } else {
    scaleFactor = printAreaHeight / (height ?? 1);
  }

  // Convert to Printify scale (assuming 1.0 = 4000 px, etc.)
  const maxPixels = Math.max(printAreaWidth, printAreaHeight);
  let scale = scaleFactor / (maxPixels / Math.max(width ?? 1, height ?? 1));

  if (scale > 1.0) scale = 1.0;

  // Centered
  const x = 0.5;
  const y = 0.5;
  const angle = 0;

  return { x, y, scale, angle };
}

You can incorporate this function into your PrintifyService and call it whenever you create a product, so you pass the (x, y, scale, angle) to createProduct().

6. Tying It All Together: A Sample Flow

	1.	Author Edits Manuscript
	•	They upload text in Markdown.
	2.	System Chunks Manuscript
	•	Each chunk can have an optional image. The user can click “Generate Image” (AI) or “Upload Image.”
	3.	(Optional) AI-Generated Image
	•	The user triggers Replicate’s Luma Photon.
	•	The resulting image is stored in your DB (Supabase or local).
	•	The user sees a thumbnail in the React frontend.
	4.	“Create Printify Product” Button
	•	Next to each chunk or image, you show an option to create a product.
	•	Clicking it calls the Express endpoint (POST /api/printify/upload or POST /api/printify/products) with the image data, blueprint selection, etc.
	5.	Blueprint Selection
	•	The React frontend fetches blueprint data from GET /api/printify/blueprints.
	•	The user picks a blueprint (T-shirt, mug, etc.)
	•	The client calls the route that handles uploadImage -> createProduct -> storeInDB.
	6.	Product Created
	•	The product is now in Printify’s system.
	•	You store the product_id in the DB, tied to the user and manuscript.
	7.	Publish
	•	If the user wants it public, you call publishProduct(productId).
	8.	View or Link
	•	On the frontend, you might show a link to the Printify product or embed it for direct checkout if you have that integration.

7. Summary & Next Steps

By modularizing each Printify-related task into pure functions and exposing them via your Express routes, you keep your codebase clean, testable, and composable. Here’s a quick recap:
	1.	Create a Printify Service Layer:
	•	Pure Functions for each major API call.
	•	Helper for AI-based placement with an image manipulation library in Node.
	2.	Add Route Handlers:
	•	Validate user roles (Supabase auth).
	•	Connect these service calls to your business logic.
	•	Return data to the client in JSON.
	3.	Integrate Drizzle:
	•	Store the mapping between your local manuscripts/users and the Printify products.
	4.	Frontend:
	•	Provide a blueprint selection UI.
	•	Provide a button to initiate product creation.
	•	Display any product links or statuses.
	5.	Refine AI (Optional):
	•	If you want advanced subject detection or composition analysis, integrate a small AI model.
	•	For more advanced or GPU-based tasks, consider a separate microservice.
	6.	Follow Business Rules:
	•	Only authenticated authors can do it.
	•	Respect the chunking logic for manuscripts.
	•	Possibly tie product creation to an “export” flow if that suits your product design.

With this functional programming approach, each part of the Printify integration is isolated, reducing coupling and making your system easier to maintain and evolve. This also aligns well with your existing React + Express + Supabase + Drizzle stack, ensuring a cohesive, type-safe, and developer-friendly workflow.
